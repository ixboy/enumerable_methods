# Advanced building Blocks Enumerable Methods

This is the implementation of Ruby Methods, we build copies of 9 different types of Ruby Enumerable methods using Ruby and we tested all of them using RSpec, the objective of this is to showcase our abilities and capabilities of working with these methods and other Ruby methods as well and the abilities to create our own custom enumerable methods if there is a need for that.

### This code includes the copies of 9 methods.
* `each` method.
* `each_with_index` method.
* `select` method.
* `all?` method.
* `any?` method.
* `none?` method.
* `count` method.
* `map` method.
* `inject` method.

#### & a method for tests
###### - `multiply_els` method.


## Built With
* `Ruby`
* `RSpec`


### Knowledge acquired during this project:
* `Test-driven programming using RSpec`
* `Implementation of several Ruby methods for Enumerable`
* `Ability to navigate through Ruby documentation while coding`

## How to test

For testing this Enumerable methods, you need to install `rspec` using `gem`. You can find more about `gem` in the Ruby documentation.

- Change to the repository directory: `cd ruby-1`
- Run the tests using `rspec`: `rspec --tty spec`
